# Product backlog

Ordered ideas for Issues that are **not yet** in active development (or are queued). Agents and humans keep this table current and **reorderable** by the **Order** column (lower = higher priority).

**Canonical file:** [docs/backlog.md](backlog.md)  
**Rule:** [.cursor/rules/backlog-management.mdc](../.cursor/rules/backlog-management.mdc)  
**Active work:** [feature/](../feature/) changelog entries — promote a backlog row into a feature doc when starting analysis.

## How to use

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| Reorder | Change **Order** integers (1, 2, 3…); keep unique contiguous ranks for `idea` / `ready` rows |
| Add | Append a row; assign next Order or insert and renumber |
| Start work | Set Status `promoted`; create/extend `feature/<slug>.md`; link in **Feature doc** |
| Drop | Status `wont` or `done` (if shipped without a prior feature doc); do not delete history rows |

### Status values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `idea` | Suggested; not analyzed |
| `ready` | Scoped enough to start feature analysis when picked |
| `promoted` | Has an active `feature/*.md` changelog (see Feature doc) |
| `done` | Shipped; keep briefly then archive or leave for history |
| `wont` | Rejected or deferred indefinitely |

## Backlog (ordered)

| Order | Status | Idea | Why / notes | Suggested slug | Feature doc |

| 11 | idea | **Dashboard widgets** — WIP, throughput, assignee, due-date, points | Suggested in [project-dashboard.md](../feature/project-dashboard.md) audit; after v3 | `project-dashboard` | [project-dashboard.md](../feature/project-dashboard.md) |
